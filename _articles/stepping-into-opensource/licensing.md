### {{ site.video }} How Does the Commons Work?

>"A Creative Commons (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted work. A CC license is used when an author wants to give people the right to share, use, and build upon a work that they have created." - [Creative Commons - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_Commons_license)

Within open source projects, there are often multiple uses of Creative Commons lincense.

### Contributor License Agreement

From time to time you will see something called a '[Contributor License Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement)'(CLA) as a prequisite to contributing to an open project.  

Read [this page](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) for more on Creative Commons licenses (what they are, what they mean).


TODO: Get some clear points about what a CLA is/is not and when you should be concerned
