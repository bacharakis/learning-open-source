There are many things to consider when evaluating a project for participation. Initial impressions are important (this looks awesome!), but so too is critical review for 'fit'. Not all projects accommodate new contributors, not all project maintainers are responsive - but may do, and are.  Here's how to step into open source:

### Two-Track Approach

Open Source is a great opportunity to learn by doing - understanding through experience. In this chapter, you can choose one of two different learning-tracks.  The first lets you experience open source, as many developers do - by building something of your own, that interacts with 3rd party OS projects.  The second, is more of a treasure hunt among existing open projects.  Neither way is better, it's only which you prefer.

Review each before selecting your track.

#### 1. Build Your Own Project

Sometimes the best way you can interact with, and learn about an open project is by building something of your own which has dependencies on open projects. This is how many developers are introduced to open source, for example a developer working with [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) or [Drupal](http://drupal.org) for an company might fix a known bug, or realize that a small change they've made for a client is probably something others would want. **A first contribution often happens this way.**

In this track you'll be given a challenge to use any existing project you're working on, or to create a small app or bot that interacts with other open projects.  

This track provides a few benefits:

* You can learn in a safe environment, how things like pull requests work, how to merge code, how to create tasks without fear of being judged in real-time.
* You can make something you really want and have - who knows, maybe it will launch something others want to get involved with!
* It mimics workplace and software development workflows where you do run into bugs with open projects. This is real-world experience in problem-solving!
* Your contribution can help others working on similar use cases - you'll likely meet people interested in the same things you are.

#### 2. Search for a Project

If you prefer to search for a project, this is also a very popular way to get involved.  There are numerous ways you can find an open project including ['Up for Grabs'](http://up-for-grabs.net), [Github](https://github.com/explore/), [Bugs Ahoy](https://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?a11y=1&simple=1) and [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/) and there is also Github's ['trending repos'](https://github.com/trending) which allow you to see what projects are most popular right now. In this way you can window-shop for opportunities and tasks that feel manageable, (and hopefully) interesting and fun.

The benefits of this approach are:

* You can select a project by the skill you want to learn.
* There's opportunity to apply our checklist(below)to assess - avoiding hostile, inactive or unresponsive communities.
* Sometimes you can specifically step into communities with people you are interested in learning from.

**Remember - in both tracks, reporting a bug, is a contribution!  As is documentation, so is writing a blog post to share your experiences.**

### HFOSS

As part of your assignment in Module 1, you might have been asked to think about your motivations for contributing to an Open Project. Enter HFOSS - or simply Humanitarian Open Source.

> Digital humanitarian communities vary in size, structure, and focus. There are well-established groups like [Sahana Foundation](https://sahanafoundation.org/) or [Ushahidi](http://sahanafoundation.org/), as well as the growing [Digital Humanitarian Network](http://digitalhumanitarians.com/). Each of these organizations, and many more digital communities, seek your expertise.  - [Getting Involved with HFOSS](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/getting-involved-hfoss), [Heather Leeson](https://opensource.com/users/hleson).


### {{ site.assignment }} - Step Into Open Source

* Read [Finding Your Goldilocks Zone](https://github.com/trending) by Alaina Kafkes
* Read [Don's Journey](https://blog.zgp.org/am-i-metal-yet/) on 'Track 1' setting up a Metalsmith blog.
* Read [11 ways to get involved with HFOSS](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/getting-involved-hfoss)
* [Read Github's 'Finding a Project to Contribute To'](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to).

Select the track you prefer, and use the checklist provided in Github's [Finding a Project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) to find 3 projects that look interesting to you and document why.

TODO: indicate where this is shared kept.

*Bonus: If you choose the [Open Source Career Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8G3cTYVBrSWcUIaU_m7Xixr3wlDS3rlBL4HvCzoPPw/edit#heading=h.oc32cqkvrlxk) from Module 1, you can use that as a tool for selecting a project as well :)*
