There are many things to consider when evaulating a project for participation.  As much as a project might sound inviting, it's important to apply critical evaulation.

### Two-Track Approach

Before we get into project evaluation, consider which of these two tracks would suit your learning style, personality, skillset and time availble.


#### 1. Build Your Own Project

We're not saying go out and create your own open source project - what we are saying is **sometimes the best way you can interact with, and learn about an open project is by building something of your own which has dependencies on open projects**.  This track provides a few benefits:

* You can learn in a safe environment, how things like pull requests work, how to merge code, how to create tasks without fear of being judged in real-time.
* At some point you will have to interact with the community, you'll report a bug...or you'll ask a question, and perhaps because you have learned how that software is supposed to work you'll submit a patch.
* You can make something you really want and have - who knows, maybe it will launch something others want to get involved with!
* It mimics workplace and software development workflows where you do run into bugs with open projects. This is real-world experience in problem-solving!

Probably the only real drawback to this track is the time you'll need to invest.


#### 2. Search for a Project

If you prefer to search for a project, this is also a very popular way to get involved.  There are numerous ways you can find an open project including ['Up for Grabs'](http://up-for-grabs.net), [Github](https://github.com/explore/), [Bugs Ahoy](https://www.joshmatthews.net/bugsahoy/?a11y=1&simple=1) and [Your First PR](https://yourfirstpr.github.io/) and there is also Github's ['trending repos'](https://github.com/trending) which allow you to see what projects are most popular right now.  The benfits of this approach are:

* You can select a project by the skill you want to learn.
* There's opportunity to apply a checklist to that project - avoiding hostile, inactive or unresponsive communities.
* Sometimes you can specfically step into communities with people you are interested in learning from.

In this track, there is a similar con - in that you might invest a bit of time in the evalulation phase, and potentially on environment builds.

**Remember - in both tracks, reporting a bug, is a contribution!  So is documentation, so is writing a blog post to share your experiences.**

### HFOSS

As part of your assignment in Module 1, you were asked to think about your motivations for contributing to an Open Project. Enter HFOSS - or simply Humanitarian Open Source.

> Digital humanitarian communities vary in size, structure, and focus. There are well-established groups like [Sahana Foundation](https://sahanafoundation.org/) or [Ushahidi](http://sahanafoundation.org/), as well as the growing [Digital Humanitarian Network](http://digitalhumanitarians.com/). Each of these organizations, and many more digital communities, seek your expertise.  - [Getting Involved with HFOSS](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/getting-involved-hfoss), [Heather Leeson](https://opensource.com/users/hleson).


### {{ site.assignment }} - Find a Project

* Read [Finding Your Goldilocks Zone](https://github.com/trending) by Alaina Kafkes
* Read [Don's Journey](https://blog.zgp.org/am-i-metal-yet/) on 'Track 1' setting up a Metalsmith blog.
* Read [11 ways to get involved with HFOSS](https://opensource.com/life/15/2/getting-involved-hfoss)
* [Read Github's 'Finding a Project to Contribute To'](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to).

Select the track you prefer, and use the checklist provided in Github's [Finding a Project](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#finding-a-project-to-contribute-to) to find 3 projects that look interesting to you and document why. 

TODO: indicate where this is shared kept.

*Bonus: If you choose the [Open Source Career Map](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u8G3cTYVBrSWcUIaU_m7Xixr3wlDS3rlBL4HvCzoPPw/edit#heading=h.oc32cqkvrlxk) from Module 1, you can use that as a tool for selecting a project as well :)*
