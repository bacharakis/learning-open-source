### Open Source is Made of Humans
We've talked a lot about 'open'. We've run through attributes that make a project most likely to be accessible for new contributors.  But, at the core of everything, and I mean everything, is that **open source is about people, solving problems for people together**.

And like any gathering of humans, be it family, a group of colleagues, a sports teams - interacting can be challenging at times. A set of unhealthy 'norms' can be established accidently when we neglect to be explicit about how we want our communities to interact and which can lead toxic communities.

**Unhealthy communities deter diverse participation and ultimately stiffle innovation.**

That's where a [Code of Conduct comes into play. 

>A Code of Conduct is an agreement outlining expectations for community participation, including what is acceptable, unacceptable and behaviors all community members should aspire to - with a clear reporting process for violations.

Here are some examples of open source community Codes of Conduct:

* [Kubernetes](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md)
* [GoLang](https://golang.org/conduct)
* [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/conduct.html)

What I want you to know is that, **without enforcement a Code of Conduct means nothing**.  Without enforcement, and modeling of healthy behavior by community leaders -  what we see is that more assertive individuals, and that those with percieved clout tend to dominate discussion. It is your role as a community member to not only abide by CoC, but to look out for others as well.  A healthy community is everyone's responsibility.
