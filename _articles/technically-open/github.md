Git is a version control system, that project teams use to track changes in code.  A version control system allows multiple people to work on the same codebase without eliminating each other's work, offeres a way to track those changes, and review and merge changes into a single release.

### {{site.video}} Watch - What is GitHub?

> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)

#### GitHub GUIs

There are a ton of great GUIs to use with GitHub as well.[1]

* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) - The downright luxurious Git client,for Windows, Mac & Linux
* [git-cola](https://git-cola.github.io/) - another git client for Windows and OS X
* [GitUp](https://github.com/git-up/GitUp) - A newish GUI that has some very opinionated ways of dealing with git's complications
* [gitx-dev](https://rowanj.github.io/gitx/) - another graphical git client for OS X
* [Source Tree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) - a free graphical git client for Windows and OS X
* [Tower](http://www.git-tower.com/) - graphical git client for OS X (paid)
* [tig](https://jonas.github.io/tig/) - terminal text-mode interface for Git

### Advanced Git

As your skills advance, there are many great (and free) courses on advanced Git , and people sharing their experiences [like this one from FreeCodeCamp's blog](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/git-cheat-sheet-and-best-practices-c6ce5321f52).

Better yet, you'll find detailed instructions for what to do for all those scenarios not covered in basic tutorials, such as in [Flight Rules for Git]([GitHub Flight Rules](https://github.com/k88hudson/git-flight-rules)) based on [Astronaut Flight Rules](http://www.jsc.nasa.gov/news/columbia/fr_generic.pdf).
