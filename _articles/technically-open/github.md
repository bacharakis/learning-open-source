Git is a version control system, that project teams use to track changes in code.  A version control system allows multiple people to work on the same codebase, without eliminating each other's work - and a way to track those changes, and review and merge changes into single releases.

### What is Github?

> GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It is mostly used for code. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.  [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)
