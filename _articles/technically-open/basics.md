### Command Line Confidence

If you are not yet familiar, or comfortable with using command line tools, this section is not only important for your open source goals, but key enabler of confidence and effectiveness in your early steps.

### {{activity}} Command Line Basics

1. Complete one of the following:
	* [Learn The Command Line](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/)  - for those with Linux of Macs who want to learn command line on their own machines.
  * Code Acadamy's ['Your First Command Line'](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/learn-the-command-line/lessons/navigation/exercises/your-first-command?action=lesson_resume).

### Communication Norms & Trends

Historically open source projects lean on tools like [IRC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) and mailing lists, [Mediawiki](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct#Appealing_a_resolution) and forums like [Discourse](https://discourse.mozilla-community.org/)  (which is open source) for communication and tracking documentation.  

Additionally communities are starting to experiment with other communication norms.  More often we are seeing tools like [Rocketchat](https://rocket.chat/), [Mattermost](https://about.mattermost.com/), [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/) used as collaborative way of sharing workflows, with itegrations for many of the tools those communities use.

**There is some tension within the open ecosystem when tools that are not themselves open are chosen, which if you completed the first module you'll recognize that tension being tied to the Internet Freedom movement and accessiblity of the tools themselves. IRC for example is considered a non-accessible tool for many non-technical contributors. 

Often communication solutions are no longer tied to a single platform, and instead a web of tools are tied together via 'briges' between tools like [Sameroom](https://sameroom.io/blog/connecting-a-channel-in-slack-to-a-channel-irc/).  Still more projects limit their dicussions to issue trackers.


### {{activity}} IRC Basics

1. Complete this [IRC tutorial](), and connect to one of these community IRC channels to say hello.
 * #openstack101
 * #wikipedia
 * #drupal
 * #umbuntu
2. For 3 open projects you've chosen in earlier modules, or any 3 open projects selected from [Github's list of good projects for beginners](https://github.com/trending) answer the following questions:
 * Where do people talk?
 * How active are the communication channels where people talk?
 * How many channels are available within a a project (are there channels for focused work, or new contributors?)
3.  Write a blog post on one of the following topics:
	*  My experience communicating with open source.
	*  Why, or why not open communities like [Creative Commons](https://slack-signup.creativecommons.org/) and [Open Data](http://slack.opendatacommunity.io/) should use a closed-source tool like Slack.
