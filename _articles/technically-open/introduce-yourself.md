### Join Mozilla's Open Source Club's Community!

Read ['We Need Students for Open Source to Thrive'](https://medium.com/mozilla-open-innovation/open-source-needs-students-to-thrive-2ff26cca4735) on Mozilla's Open Innovation blog.

> “An [Open Source Club] member recently told me that one of the reasons he joined was that he wanted to be able to code along side other people and help them solve problems with their code. He didn’t feel like he could normally do that in his classes without being accused of helping people ‘cheating.” — Wes, Rensselaer Polytechnic
