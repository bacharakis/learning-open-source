### {{ site.video }} The Mozilla Story: Making The World You Want


It's easy to forget, that not that long ago, a single company controlled the majority of software and hardware - that open was something mostly associated with 'basement hackers' and that as a business model was considered invalid.   Enter Mozilla Firefox 1.0

Mozilla injected competition, innovation and opportunity by opening the source code for Netscape. 

* [Watch this video interview with Mozilla Chairwoman](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/16/the-mozilla-story-making-the-world-you-want/) Mitchell Baker, and former Mozilla CEO Chris Lily as they revisit that time - and how it changed everything.

* (Optional) Watch the short animated video of the Mozilla story.
