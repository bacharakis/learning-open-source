### Free Software Foundation

> In the early 1980’s Richard Stallman founded the Free Software Foundation: a socio-technological movement that revolutionized the software world. Stallman and Tim O’Reilly – a pioneer of Open Source – tell the story. [[1]](#history-stallman)

### {{ site.video }} The Mozilla Story: Making The World You Want

Not that long ago, a single company(Microsoft) controlled the majority of software and hardware - that 'open' was something mostly associated with 'basement hackers' and that as a open source business model was considered laughable.

* [Watch this video interview with Mozilla Chairwoman](https://techcrunch.com/2015/09/16/the-mozilla-story-making-the-world-you-want/) Mitchell Baker, and former Mozilla CEO Chris Lily as they revisit that time - and how it changed everything.

### Into the Future!
Don Marti explains in his blog post ['Why Open Source Matters'](https://blog.zgp.org/misc/why-open-source-matters/) what he sees as the 3 movements of Open Source (explained with quotes), and insists that anyone "trying to sell you on joining “open source” is selling a different combination of these".


#### Software development methodology
> “In short, the effect on security of open source software is still a major debate in the security community, though a large number of prominent experts believe that it has great potential to be more secure.” -  [David A. Wheeler](https://www.dwheeler.com/secure-programs/Secure-Programs-HOWTO/open-source-security.html)
>  
    Opportunity: Building software we can be proud of
    Fail: Software Quality

#### Internet freedom campaign
> “My free software will respect users or it will be bullshit” — [Matthew Garrett](https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/32686.html)
>  
     Opportunity: Build the power structures you want
      Fail: Diversity and inclusion

#### Economic movement

> “Linux Foundation certifications give you a way to differentiate yourself in a job market that’s hungry for your skills.” — [Linux Foundation](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification)
>
    Opportunity: Hiring, discoverability and incentivization
    Fail: Compensation and burnout
