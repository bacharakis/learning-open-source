Contributing to Open Source software is truly an opportunity to grow as an individual, gain new skills, find unparalleled opportunity for leadership, and perhaps to change the world in the process.  It can also be a tricky place to navigate various project norms and personalities in the quest to achieving those goals.

### Personal Inspiration

Inspiration has many incarnations - we can find it in experiences, interactions, and in opportunity.  Take some time to read through the stories of community listed below.

>"**Contributing also makes me prioritize working on open source code**. I now understand just how cool it is to be able to "ping" an expert when you need help. For example, when we were building the user namespaces support into Docker, a kernel maintainer for namespaces commented on the pull request and made sure it was implemented correctly. It's so valuable for a project to not only have input from others but from the actual people who built what you are trying to integrate." - Jess Frazelle

>Working on it helped me a lot, because I earned many of the skills I later used for my studies in University and my actual job. - Errietta Kostala

>That was only half of what impressed the interviewer, though: the other reason is that he'd shown the foresight to get out there and get experience for himself.
