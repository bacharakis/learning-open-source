### Inspiration

Contributing to Open Source software is truly an opportunity to grow as an invidual, gain new skills, find unparralelled opportunity for leadership and perhaps to change the world in the process.  It can also be a tricky place to navigate various project norms, and personalities in the quest to achieving those goals.

>"**Contributing also makes me prioritize working on open source code**. I now understand just how cool it is to be able to "ping" an expert when you need help. For example, when we were building the user namespaces support into Docker, a kernel maintainer for namespaces commented on the pull request and made sure it was implemented correctly. It's so valuable for a project to not only have input from others but from the actual people who built what you are trying to integrate." - Jess Frazelle
