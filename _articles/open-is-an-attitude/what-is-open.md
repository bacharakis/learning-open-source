# What do we mean by 'Open'?

'Open' can be broken down to a variety of actions and attributes that together form an innovative ecosystem.

Watch this light introduction to open source, using a cooke recipe to represent software, licensing and collaboration.

## Open is a Verb
**Open is truly a decision**, and purposeful **action** - one that invites others in to collaborate, innovate and build together. 

### > Access

Open access refers to the practice of **making peer-reviewed scholarly research and literature freely available online** to anyone interested in reading it. Open access has two different versions--**gratis and libre**. The difference is the choice of copyright - with Gratis being 'read only', and Libre allowing distributing and reuse. [1]  

*Imagine the potential for scientific breakthroughs as more research is made openly available.*

### > Use


>..if a work is open, then the right of use is assumed. The fact that definitions of openness must explicitly spell out restricted uses makes it clear that if a work is open, **then any and all of the things that it may be possible to do with it are allowed, unless explicitly disallowed**.

*Consider your assumptions about use, and what explicit restrictions you have seen in licencsed software or content.*


## Open is an Adjective
Open is often how we describe open ecosystems, how they do and do not work to enable greater openess.

### > Transparent
Working in the open can mean many things, primarily it means 'making your work visible', and how people interact with that work will atually begin your journey of open.  Working more openly is also about making decision-making processes, and governance open for others to co-design.

> The main value of working open is reducing transaction cost, administrivia, and collaborative friction with smart communities of peers. That's different than over-relying on the casually offered opinions of whoever shows up, or waiting for the crowd to do your work or solve your problems for you." - Matt Thompson [4].

*What ways can you be more transparent in your development workflow? How might you hold yourself accountable for being open?*

### > Participatory

Working openly, you might assume, enables project participation - but **engaging diverse perspectives, ways of working and enabling success project -  endeavor requires purposeful engagement**.

> The 2009 "Memorandum on Transparency and Open Government" emphasizes transparency, participation, and collaboration. Much of the emphasis of open government is on transparency, but information about what the government is doing is meaningless without the ability for citizens to then act on that information to exert influence on the government. This, of course, is almost a definition of participatory democracy.[1]

* What ways might a project deter participation even if their work is openly shared?*

## Open is a Noun


### > Source

The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.[5]

### > Speech, Beer, Puppies

'Free' has a few meanings in the context of open source. Free as in Beer refers to the cost of software, while 'Free as in Speech' refers to what you can do with the software. 'Free as in puppies' is also used to describe the cost of maintaining software.

The Free Software Foundation (FSF) found it necessary to define what it means for software to be free. According to the Free Software Definition, four essential freedoms must exist for users of free software:

- **Freedom 0**: The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
- **Freedom 1**: The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
- **Freedom 2**: The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.
- **Freedom 3**: The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. [1]

*Can you think of free beer, speech and puppy examples in your life?*

## Open is an Attitude

For all else, Open is an attitude - where innovation meets human determination to continually design and innovate for ways we can 

### > Enabling

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) did not develop the [Free Software Definition](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html) or the [Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd), or indeed any definition of what it means for particular types of resources to be open. Instead, Creative Commons developed a [set of licenses](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/) and an online tool to help with using these licenses. 

In so doing, Creative Commons became a very powerful enabler of openness.  *This content contains CC licensed material, attributed at the end of this page.*

Acting as an enabler of openness is another meaning of the term "open," and one that is somewhat more oblique than those that have been discussed so far. "Open" in this sense does not, like open source or open access, refer to a specific type of resource. **Rather, it refers to a set of affordances (Gibson, 2014), either technical or legal, for a specific type of resource, of which a user may make use[1]**.

*How have you seen Creative Commons licenses enabling open work (hint, you can find it in this page :)*

### > Working

  title="A Working Open Example - STEMM Role Models, Kirstie Whitaker" %}
  
 Working open can be described as having: 

- **participation**. rocket fuel for smart collaboration.
- **agility**. speed. flexibility. getting shit done.
- **momentum**. communities want to push boulders that are already rolling.
- **testing and rapid prototyping**. iterating and refining as we go.
- **leverage**. getting greater bang from limited resources. punching above our weight.[4]

*How might you convince someone who feels protective of their idea/and or software project to begin working openly?*

## Open is Not

Open has also become a buzzword for industry, individuals and corperations looking to exploit (purposely or otherwise) the popularity and uptake of open source software in reason years.  

### > Exploitation
Creating appearances of being open to engage people for free labour, fake consultation or as a way to draw attention to oneself are all ways people exploit 'Open'.

>Open is not:
>
>- **public performance**. creating the fake appearance of consultation.
- **endless opinion-sharing**. never-ending "feedback." bike-shedding.
- **magic "crowd-sourcing."** crowds aren't smart -- communities of peers are. [4] Matt Thompson>

*How would you recognize exploitation of open?  Can you think of any examples?*

### > Open Washing
[Open Washing](http://openwashing.org/) is a term given to a specific type of exploitation.

>Openwashing: to spin a product or company as open, although it is not. Derived from 'greenwashing.' [Michelle Thorn](http://michellethorne.cc/2009/03/openwashing/)

>Openwashing: n., having an appearance of open-source and open-licensing for marketing purposes, while continuing proprietary practices. [Audrey Watters](https://twitter.com/audreywatters/status/184387170415558656)
